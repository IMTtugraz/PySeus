Updating the documentation
--------------------------

The documentation for PySeus is created with `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>` using the `Read-the-Docs Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`.

These dependencies are setup if you run ``pip install requirements.txt`` from the root directory.
After making changes, run ``./make.bat html`` or ``make html``; the new files are under *docs/build/html*.
