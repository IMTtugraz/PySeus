**Menu bar**: The menu bar at the top allows access to all functions. See 
`Navigation<usage/navigation>`_ for the *View* and *Explore* menus and 
`Evaluate<usage/evalute>`_ for the *Tools* menu.

**Thumbnails**: For datasets with multiple scans, thumbnails of each scan are 
dispalyed on the left. Clicking on a thumbnail will load the scan.

`Navigation<usage/navigation>`_ for how to adjust the viewport.

**Sidebar**: The Sidebar collects various kinds of information.

*File info*: Basic information about the current dataset is displayed at the 
top. This contains the dataset path, the current scan and the current slice.

*Metadata*: If a dataset contains metadata, the most common items are 
displayed here. Clicking on "*more*" at the bottom will bring up a window
with all available metadata.

*Console*: Generic text output (like from the area tool) is displayed here.

**Status bar**: The status bar at the bottom provides contextual information. 
While hovering over the image viewport, the coordinates and value of the pixel 
under the cursor are displayed.
